      "title": "How To Overcome 5 Common Problems Faced By Students In eLearning",
      "body": "eLearning, being the latest wave of education, is already having a fair show despite posing challenges for both instructors and students. While instructors need to put in intensive work and time to design the instruction, students need to equip themselves with technical proficiency to decode the course material. There are 5 common problems faced by students in eLearning classes and which they need to be solved through proper initiatives for the students' future benefits:\n\n1. Adaptability Struggle.  \nSwitching from traditional classroom and face to face instructor training to computer-based training in a virtual classroom makes the learning experience entirely different for students. Their resistance to change doesn't allow them to adapt to the online learning environment, whereas it takes time for them to get accustomed to Course Management Systems (CMS) and the methods of computer-based education. While passive listening and notes taking are expected in a traditional classroom, online discussions or creating a web page demand springing into action. Students with a 'traditional' mindset find it difficult to adapt; however, they need to accept the new learning circumstances with an open mind and heart. Understanding the benefits of eLearning and even discussing them with their peers may change this mindset and better prepare students for online classes.\n\n2. Technical Issues.\nMany students are not provided with the high bandwidth or the strong internet connection that online courses require, and thus fail to catch up with their virtual classmates: Their weak monitors make it hard to follow the Course Management System and their learning experience becomes problematic. Moreover, most of them live off campus and find it difficult to keep in tune with the technical requirements of the chosen course. Some of them don't even own computers and seek help in Learning Resource Centers for technical assistance. The only solution to this problem is knowing exactly what kind of technological support they will need for a certain course before enrolling in it, as well as properly equipping themselves for the course's successful completion.\n\n3. Computer Literacy.\nAlthough students are generally tech savvy, and thus able to manage computers well, lack of computer literacy is a major issue among students today. Many of them cannot operate basic programs such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and therefore are not able to handle their files. Furthermore, many students find fixing basic computer problems troublesome, as they have no knowledge in this area. However, technological proficiency is a must for following online courses, as it enables students to manage their assignments and courseware in an organized manner without struggling. Basic courses in computer literacy enhance students' knowledge in the field; having a fundamental knowledge of computer hardware would help them participate in online classes without interruptions and hindrances.\n\n4. Time Management.\nTime management is a difficult task for eLearners, as online courses require a lot of time and intensive work. Furthermore, whereas it is mostly adults who prefer web-based learning programs for their place and time flexibility, they rarely have the time to take the courses due to their various everyday commitments. A regular schedule planner would be a significant help to these learners, as they could even set reminders for their courses and assignments.\n\n5.Self-Motivation.\nSelf-motivation is an eLearning essential requirement; however, many online learners lack it, much to their surprise. After enrolling in distance learning courses, many learners fall behind and nurture the idea of giving up, as difficulties in handling a technological medium also seem insurmountable. Students need to find the motivation to follow the new educational trends and also properly equip themselves for future challenges in their education and careers. Only a positive attitude will help them overcome the challenges in eLearning; though this is hard to practice, students need to understand that it is necessary in order to reap the eLearning's benefits in the future.\n",

      "body": "Here are some suggestions for how you can help people living with anxiety and depression:\n\nEncourage them to seek help\nPerhaps the most important thing you can do is encourage them to seek appropriate treatment. You can reassure them by letting them know that help is out there, and that you will be there to support them.\n\nDon't be afraid to bring it up\nIt takes a lot for someone to say, 'I need help', but it doesn't hurt to raise the subject yourself. Try to be open about depression and difficult emotions, so they know that it's OK to talk about what they're experiencing. Sometimes, you don't have to explicitly talk about mental health to find out how they are doing - it can be as simple as texting them to let them know you're thinking of them, or suggesting that you go out for dinner or a walk.\n\nDon't blame them\nTry not to blame them for feeling anxious or depressed, or tell them to 'pull themselves together'. They are probably already blaming themselves, and criticism is likely to make them feel even worse.\n\nBe patient\nSomeone with depression may get more irritable, and be more liable to misunderstand others, or feel misunderstood, than usual. They may need reassurance in some situations.\n\nLook after yourself\nYour mental health is important, too, and looking after someone else could put a strain on your wellbeing. If you are able to stay well, you are more likely to be able to provide good support for longer. This could include trying to stay healthy and physically active, confiding in someone - other than the person you are worried for \u00AD- taking a break from time to time and being realistic about what you can and can't do yourself. Mind has lots of advice on helping someone else.",

These affect the way we think, feel and behave towards others and ourselves.\n\nWe don't always think, feel and behave in exactly the same way - it depends on the situation we are in, the people with us and many other things. But we mostly tend to behave in fairly predictable ways.\n\nPersonality disorders are a type of mental health problem where your attitudes, beliefs and behaviours cause you longstanding problems in your life. Your experience of personality disorder is unique to you. However, you may often experience difficulties in how you think about yourself and others.

PTSD can be triggered by anything that consciously, or unconsciously, reminds an individual of a specific trauma in their lives. For some people, this is a single, major, significant event - such as a car accident - and for others an ongoing series of events, such as being in conflict zones, or experiencing abuse.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD don't necessarily emerge straight away, and in some, don't develop until many years after the event. They can include vivid flashbacks, nightmares, lack of sleep and feeling emotionally cut-off. PTSD is surprisingly common - as many as 10% of the population will experience it at some time in their lives.\n\nIf someone has been living with distressing symptoms for over a month after a traumatic event they should see their GP, who can refer them for specialist help. Effective treatment does exist, and you can recover from PTSD.",

Anyone taking antidepressants should be made aware of the possible pros and cons for them, and they should have their treatment reviewed regularly.\n\nTalking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling are becoming more widely available as part of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme. Giving people a choice of treatments is key, whether that's drugs, talking therapies, or alternatives such as arts therapy or exercise.",

      "body": "We all have mental health to look after, as well as physical health, and the way we live our lives has a direct influence on them both. There are lots of small things we can change to improve or maintain good mental health and wellbeing without spending lots of money to do it.\n\nDiet\nEating fresh fruit and vegetables daily helps provide the nutrients needed to nourish your mind and body. Keeping regular meal times and choosing foods that release energy slowly, such as oats and unrefined wholegrains, also help. Reducing your intake of caffeine, alcohol and sugary foods in the evening also helps as they can all disturb your sleep patterns.\n\nSleep\nThere's a close relationship between sleep and mental health. Living with a mental health problem can affect how well you sleep, and poor sleep can have a negative impact on your mental health, so prioritising sleep can help both with maintaining your wellbeing and your recovery.\n\nBeing outdoors\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that the combined mix of colours, sounds and smells we find outdoors act together to stimulate our senses, which helps increase our overall wellbeing. This means that gardening and other outdoor hobbies often provide a brilliant alternative to traditional sports and exercise.\n\nExercise\nStructured physical activity can play a key role in someone's recovery from a mental health problem and in staying well for years to come. When you exercise, your brain chemistry changes through the release of 'feel good' hormones called endorphins.\n\nJoining activity groups such as a running club is a fantastic way of improving your social network. Being sociable and connecting with other people is rewarding in its own right and can significantly improve mental wellbeing. Group yoga or Pilates classes can help you learn breathing techniques, which can encourage you to relax and switch off from external stresses.",

If you have been asked by a recruiter or company for a CV/resume of a certain length, then it's best to comply with their wishes, but if you haven't been given a steer (which you usually won't have been) then a good yardstick is 2 - 3 pages. A one size fits all approach doesn't factor in different levels of seniority, so work on the basis that a more junior person's CV/resume is likely to be no more than 2 pages and a more senior person would be nearer 3. There are regional variations too; a UK CV is typically more detailed and longer than a US resume, and in the UK market, Contractors / Interim Managers are forgiven for having a CV up to 4 pages in length. South African CVs are usually very detailed and can sometimes be several pages in length and the Australian market is very much aligned with the UK. Most regions around the world stick to somewhere between 2 and 3 pages, so that's a good yardstick.

First-person on the other hand, is written from the writer's perspective and uses pronouns such as I and my.

It's about the Celestine Monks who believe in fate and that some people are sent into your life for a reason, which may not be immediately obvious to you. If you embrace the opportunity, good things will happen. There are certain situations in my life where I have engaged with someone that I didn't immediately see the point of engaging with and good things have happened thereafter. This is how I view networking - if you are open to connecting and engaging with people, who knows what opportunity might come your way as a result. It's fair to say that the more people you have in your network, the more likely it is that opportunities will come your way. My advice is to take the second and more open approach and see what happens. If someone proves to be a nuisance, you can always remove them from your network retrospectively without them being notified that this has happened. On the other hand, it may be a recruiter that wants to talk to you about an amazing job or it may be someone that ends up being of true value to your career or life.",

Most recruiters are happy to provide feedback to job seekers, but if there are 100+ applicants for every role, it is simply impossible to contact all these people to explain why they weren't successful with their applications.

Assuming the average employee sticks around for approximately three years, we then multiply this figure by three to get the real cost of hiring you. You might be surprised by the number. This puts into perspective the fact that a couple of hours of preparation is wholly inadequate and out of kilter with what a salesperson would do before a 'real' sales meeting if they were pitching for a contract of that size. My advice, especially the more senior you become, is to do about 2 days / 15 hours of preparation for each interview.

If the job description specifically asks you to write a cover letter then of course, you should. I would argue that in this scenario, you should think of it more as a supporting statement that lays out why you are a suitable candidate for the role. A cover letter, by definition, is more of a cover note that explains why you are sending your CV/resume, opposed to why you are an appropriate candidate for the job. If there is no indication that you should send a cover letter, it is not going to do you any harm sending one, but it may be a waste of your time and effort, as in most cases, the recruiter will be more inclined to read your CV/resume than they will your cover letter. In fact, I spent over five years in recruitment and never read a cover letter once, as I expected the CV/resume to tell me everything I needed to know. I did however ask shortlisted candidates to send me a supporting statement that explained how they matched the job description. So, the answer is, send a cover letter if asked for one, but write it more as a supporting statement; if you are not asked for one, it's not going to do any harm sending one, but it's likely to be time and effort that has no bearing on your application.",

His interests lie in sports and musculoskeletal medicine, having worked with the Army and in the Army Reserve, with various rugby teams and in occupational medicine (in mining). This interest is also reflected by his own regular pursuits in running and skiing. Dr Ng is a QA examiner for the Royal Australian College of GPs and has been involved in medical education including GP registrars and mentoring medical students. In his practice, rather than relying on medical treatment, he is particularly keen to stress the role of diet, exercise and personal responsibility to maintain health."
